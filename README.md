# Rosalind-Python-Scripts
A repo to store Python scripts I wrote to tackle some of the Rosalind challenges. 
The challenges can be found here : 

http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track

Generally I use Python3 in Spyder3 for these challenges, in an attempt to build on my Python skills.

Each script in the Scripts directory usually requires at least one text file containing relevant data input which was copied or downloaded from Rosalind during the challenges. These can be found in the Input_Data directory.
